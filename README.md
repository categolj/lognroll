> [!NOTE]
> This is a hobby project designed to facilitate the verification of log ingestion with OTLP. It is not intended for use in environments where reliability or high performance is required.

## Run with Pre-built Native Binaries

Lognroll offers pre-built binaries for x86_64-pc-linux, aarch64-pc-linux, x86_64-apple-darwin, and aarch64-apple-darwin. If you are using one of these environments, downloading these binaries is the easiest way to get started.

* For x86_64-pc-linux
```
curl -sL -o lognroll https://github.com/categolj/lognroll/releases/download/tip/lognroll-x86_64-pc-linux 
```
* For aarch64-pc-linux
```
curl -sL -o lognroll https://github.com/categolj/lognroll/releases/download/tip/lognroll-aarch64-pc-linux 
```
* For x86_64-apple-darwin (Intel Mac)
```
curl -sL -o lognroll https://github.com/categolj/lognroll/releases/download/tip/lognroll-x86_64-apple-darwin
```
* For aarch64-apple-darwin (Apple Silicon)
```
curl -sL -o lognroll https://github.com/categolj/lognroll/releases/download/tip/lognroll-aarch64-apple-darwin
```

After downloading the appropriate binary, you can start lognroll with the following commands:

```
mkdir -p data
chmod +x lognroll
./lognroll --lognroll.db.path=./data/lognroll.db --server.port=4318
```

* Web UI: http://localhost:4318 (username: empty, password: same as token bellow)
* OTLP/HTTP endpoint: http://localhost:4318/v1/logs
* Default bearer token: `changeme` (you can change the token with `--lognroll.auth.token=verysecuretoken`)

## Run with Docker

Run with the native image version. It starts up quickly (usually in less than a second), but it does not currently work on Arm environments such as Apple Silicon.

```
mkdir -p data
docker run --rm -p 4318:4318 -v ./data:/data -e LOGNROLL_DB_PATH=/data/lognroll.db ghcr.io/categolj/lognroll:native
```

Or the JVM version will work in any environment.

```
mkdir -p data
docker run --rm -p 4318:4318 -v ./data:/data -e LOGNROLL_DB_PATH=/data/lognroll.db ghcr.io/categolj/lognroll:jvm
```

## Build and run

Java 21+ is required.

```
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/lognroll-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

or

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

For Native Image Build, run the following command. The native image (`./target/lognroll`) created here should work on the environment where it was built, including Arm.

```
./mvnw -Pnative -DskipTests native:compile
```

## Send a example record

```
cat src/test/resources/logs.json | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer changeme" -s http://localhost:4318/v1/logs --data-binary @- -v
```

then, check the stored data

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:4318/api/logs -H "Authorization: Bearer changeme" | jq .

  {
    "logId": 1,
    "timestamp": "2018-12-13T14:51:00.300Z",

      ],
      "double.attribute": 637.704,
      "string.attribute": "some string",
      "map.attribute": {
        "some.map.key": "some value"
      },
      "boolean.attribute": true,
      "my.scope.attribute": "some scope attribute"
    },
    "resourceAttributes": {}
  }
]
```

Go to the web UI http://localhost:4318 (username: empty, password: `changeme` same as token)

Clear the `from` field since the sample log is too old and click the "View Logs" button, you'll see the search result as below:
